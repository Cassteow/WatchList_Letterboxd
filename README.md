# WatchList ðŸŽ¬
WatchList is a **hybrid group recommendation system** for **film and TV** content using Letterboxd profile data and Netflix Watch History.

## Project Overview
WatchList allows users to choose between the option of generating individual recommendations for themselves or generating group recommendations for groups up to 3 users. 
This research project seeks to develop WatchList as a film and television group recommendation system using a hybrid approach and machine learning techniques, that uses user data from OTT and/or reviewing platforms to generate a list of personalized recommendations, with the option to implement results filtering. 
WatchList adopts a hybrid approach, where content-based filtering and collaborative filtering are applied through Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency, Cosine Similarity, and Singular Value Decomposition. 
For the group recommendation component, it aggregates the individual recommendations of all users and sorts it based on an expert-user-weighted approach.

## WatchList Features
- Choose between generating individual or group recommendations.
- For users that choose group recommendations, select the number of users (up to 3) involved.

  - Netflix Watch History (in csv format)
  - Letterboxd Username
